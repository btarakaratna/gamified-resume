# 🎮 Gamified Interactive Resume: Skill Match Memory Game

**Gamified Interactive Resume** is an immersive, click-based memory game that transforms a traditional résumé into an engaging experience.  
Instead of reading sections, players *unlock* them — by flipping and matching skill cards to reveal key professional details, achievements, and education.

---

## 🚀 Concept

The project redefines how a résumé can be presented — blending **game design mechanics** with a **professional portfolio**.  
Each successful skill match unlocks a new résumé section (About, Skills, Education, Experience, Projects, Achievements, etc.), providing a playful yet insightful journey through your professional profile.
